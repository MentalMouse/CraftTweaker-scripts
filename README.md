# CraftTweaker-scripts
A place for my CraftTweaker scripts.  So far, those all link Mystical Agriculture with other mods.

ETA 5/6/12:  All of these were written for MC 1.11.2 and the matching mods; they may need fixing for 1.12.2, much less 1.13.

So far I have the following scripts:

ma-spawn_eggs.zs:       Lets you use MA essences to make spawn eggs

ma-spawn_eggs-hard.zs:  More expensive (perhaps more balanced?) version of making spawn eggs.

ma-ore_dyes.zs:         Fills in the missing 4 dye-essence recipes, using oredict dyes from other mods.

ma-quark-blocks.zs:     Recipes for blocks provided by Quark.

ma-bop-blocks.zs:       Recipes for blocks provided by Biomes O'Plenty

ma-bop-plants.zs:       Create or duplicate the various BoP plants and flowers. (now including wood/saplings)
                        
ma-v-plants.zs:         Create or duplicate vanilla plants and flowers.
