# CraftTweaker-scripts
A place for my CraftTweaker scripts.  So far, those all link Mystical Agriculture with other mods.

So far I have the following scripts:

ma-spawn_eggs.zs:     Lets you use MA essences to make spawn eggs
ma-ore_dyes.zs:       Fills in the missing 4 dye-essence recipes, using oredict dyes from other mods.
ma-quark-blocks.zs:   Recipes for blocks provided by Quark.

ma-bop-blocks.zs:     Recipes for blocks provided by Biomes O'Plenty
ma-bop-plants.zs:     Create or duplicate the various BoP plants and flowers.
ma-v-plants.zs:       Do the same for vanilla plants and flowers
